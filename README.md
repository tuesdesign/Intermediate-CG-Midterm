The Force Field Shader was very similar to the hologram shader from the tutorial. I added a texture to sample transparency and a bool to toggle the effect.

The Texture switching was written entirely by me. Depending on the state of a toggle, one of 2 textures will be sampled to be output as the shader's rgb values.
